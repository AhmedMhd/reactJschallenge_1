ReactJs_Challenge_1

This solution for a challenge was given by a Computiq team from link:

https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6

Brief:
Your challenge is to build out this product feedback application and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
Filter suggestions by category
Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
Upvote product feedback requests
#Bonus: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
